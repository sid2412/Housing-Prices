# Housing-Prices
Exploratory data analysis and machine learning modelling for housing prices in Ames, Iowa

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Please refer to data_description.txt for descriptions of features. This repository contains the notebook itself along with the raw data and predictions.
